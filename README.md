# LapSRN_TextImages_git

This work adapted [the method of 
Wei-Sheng Lai et al.](https://github.com/phoenix104104/LapSRN) to do super-resolution on (English, French and Vietnamese) text images. 
We also added Gradient Different Loss (GDL) to L1 loss to sharpen the output. 

Training and testing datasets can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E7uOpiOwTSvxsIvcoIvjX-0P2OlgaZUg?usp=sharing).
